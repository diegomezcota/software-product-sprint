        <h2>About myself</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Diego Gómez Cota, you can call me Diegomez. I am a junior Computer Science student at Tecnológico de Monterrey.
            I am Mexican, love seafood, music (specially techno and hip-hop), and soccer. I come from Sinaloa (north-west coast), I enjoy 
            hot weather and the beach.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love tech because we can use it as a tool for helping each other.
            It's incredible that you can relate anything you can imagine to tech and have the ability
            to deliver a change in those areas. Music, science, and human-interaction are great examples
            just to name a few. 
        </p>
        <h2>My projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>ZoneDash</h3>
                <p>
                    I was an intern at Uber last summer. I worked in the Cloud's host-supply team, and my project was to build a web
                    dashboard where infrastructure engineers can now check high-level server's status and relevant metrics for their team.
                    We called it ZoneDash.
                </p>

            <li>
                <h3>Mariano</h3>
                <p>
                    Me and my friends built Mariano in a hackathon, a WhatsApp chatbot that solves FAQs from residents of our college dorms.
                    We won 1st place.

                <h3>Roundup</h3>
                <p>
                    My team and I developed Roundup as our project of our Videogames course. It promotes staying at home in order to keep 
                    ourselves safe from the pandemic.
